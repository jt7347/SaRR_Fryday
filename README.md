Hello! This is a repo to store the code for our MAE322 Design Course Search and Rescue Robot. This code contains basic manual control functionality alongside autonomous drive functions such that the robot can navigate the MAE322 course fully autonomously.

Here's our robot in action! It can complete the course in about 1 minute and 40 seconds without manual input. To do so, the same photoresistor and IR sharp sensors from the course sample robots were used alongside a basic 'bang-bang' control algorithm. Given that the scope of this course's final project did not require extreme precision, our team focused on basic methods that emphasized replicability for future students. Sorry for the video orientation at the start :)
